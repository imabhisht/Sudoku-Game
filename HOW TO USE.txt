##INSTRUCTION##

The 'generate.py' contains Sudoku[easy] Puzzle. I have also mention an insane
level Sudoku Puzzle. 

To Edit/Add Custom Solveable Sudoku Puzzle, Edit the List(alpha1)  with Commas
Seperated with Values Mention. Each row represent seperate List in 'alpha1'.

Vacant or Empty Box of Sudoku Puzzle is mentioned as 'int(0)' on the List.

Warning:- Mantain the List(alpha1) with all Commas. All values are in INTEGER
form so dont add Character (or) use str(x).

Thanks......
